Data Set 1
Visualizations - Basic Data Munging


         1. Using SQLAlchemy to query data from database
         2. Visualize different sorts of data using matplotlib with histograms
         3. See what users tend to do what via ratios of user referral types to counts
         4. Discuss insights that are supposed to be gained from visualizing the data
         5. Go through a few more visualizations comapring different columns of the tables to understand biases and trends in data



Numerical insights:

        1. Using SQLAlchemy and Pandas do extensive data transforms to get ready to feed data in to scikit learn
        2. Scikit learn: Introduction to Cohort Analysis - go in to objectives of cohort analysis and why we want to do it with this data
            Objectives; Calculate churn of likes vs doing "nothing", Predict who is likely to buy more and from there being able to conclude the worth of each user leveraging cost benefit analysis
       3. Leveraging what we know about user tendencies (facebook users te
       and to like food x) build a mini collaborative filter to demonstrate how to reccomend things to users, which will lead to conversions (likes/shares/buys



Data Set 2:

      1. Use Pandas to load the data in to a dataframe
      2. Visualizing the data using matplotlib we will go over things like calculating averge site visit time and doing basic statistical inference over different columns
      3. Regression over certain columns to see what can correlate - explain r^2 and also be able to use the features to predict the probability a user will actually log in in 6 months
