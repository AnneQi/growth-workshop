Data Set 1
Visualizations - Basic Data Munging


         1. Using SQLAlchemy to query data from database
         2. Visualize different sorts of data using matplotlib with histograms
         3. See what users tend to do what via ratios of user referral types to counts
         4. Discuss insights that are supposed to be gained from visualizing the data
         5. Go through a few more visualizations comapring different columns of the tables to understand biases and trends in data



Numerical insights:

        1. Data Preparation - Using SQL to query our customer database, we'll load the data into a Pandas DataFrame to do the extensive data transforms to get the data ready to feed into scikit-learn models. 
        2. Cohort Analysis - What is cohort analysis and why does it matter? Regression vs. classification and the trade-offs of each. We will explore the pros and cons of each model, how well they scale, and how to make their output actionable. Business objectives will also be covered, specifically profit curves, lift curves, life-time value (LTV), and how to target which customers when. 
            Objectives; Calculate churn of likes vs doing "nothing", Predict who is likely to buy more and from there being able to conclude the worth of each user leveraging cost benefit analysis
       3. Leveraging what we know about user tendencies (facebook users te
       and to like food x) build a mini collaborative filter to demonstrate how to reccomend things to users, which will lead to conversions (likes/shares/buys



Data Set 2:

      1. Use Pandas to load the data in to a dataframe
      2. Visualizing the data using matplotlib we will go over things like calculating averge site visit time and doing basic statistical inference over different columns
      3. Regression over certain columns to see what can correlate - explain r^2 and also be able to use the features to predict the probability a user will actually log in in 6 months
