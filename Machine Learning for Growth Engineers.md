Machine Learning for Growth Engineers
==================================================


Before Beginning:

       We need to install python if you don't have it already. If you are on windows, please go here and install it:


               https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/

        After this, we will be leveraging the scipy stack and will thus need to set this up as well:

              http://www.scipy.org/install.html



        OSX users will already have python installed.

      You will also need git. If you are on windows go here:

              http://git-scm.com/download/win









In this workshop, we will be covering how to interpret website visits and growth metrics to predict everything from customer churn, to figuring out how to estimate a customers life time value. We will be using 2 different data sets. One is a data set based on a pinterest like website for food where users have different activities they can perform:

            Buying
            Liking
            Sharing


 The food items on the website are broken in to very simple categories for the sake of brevity:


            japanese
            chinese
            french
            german
            italian
            mexican,
            vietnamese



 These users come from different social networks:



           Facebook
           Twitter
           Reddit
           Pinterest


The goal for the first set of exercises will be to analyze and find different tendencies of users coming from different social networks.

We will be doing a series of exercises that amounts to first understanding the data we have been given, and from there running a series of tests

on the data to compute various statistics that we can then use to make inferences.



First we will need to visualize the data. We need to understand the distribution (counts) of users and run comparisons across different metrics and activities.

From there, we will be able to make educated guesses about the data as well as what goes in to basic data exploratory analysis.

Let's start with a basic understanding of the data with just some histograms. Histograms are a visualization to show the counts of different types of a user.

An example might be:
                   
                   Facebook 32
                   Twitter  55
                   Reddit 66
                   Pinterest 72

A histogram is just a visual representation of the random variable (think of it like a database column) and the counts of the different values they take on.


First let's doing some data exploration. We will need to visualize the data in order to understand it.

Let's open up visualize.py.

We will see some basic visualization code. One thing of importance is the following:


          campaign_to_num = {
	             'TW' : 1,
	             'RE' : 2,
                  'FB' : 3,
                 'PI' : 4
           } 

A histogram in matplotlib takes what amounts to bins of numbers. When we want to do different counts, we will want to translate whatever metric we want to look at to a numerical discrete or ordinal value.


The key takeaway here is how to use visualizations to understand a distribution of data. We will notice that there is a pretty even count of each type.

We won't find much information here, let's move on to trying to derive tendencies of different kinds of users.

Let's think about what kind of questions we want to ask. When we want to understand different kinds of users, we want to understand their behavior.

Their behavior allows us to optimize for business objective such as ad spend (where do I advertise?), what users are likely to buy what categories of items,

and perhaps, what users are likely to share. We can use the sum of these underlying insights to drive profits, increase conversions, and make more educated, 

data driven decision in our day to day coding and product management decisions.
